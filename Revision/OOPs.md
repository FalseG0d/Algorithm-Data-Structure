# OOP - Object Oriented Programing

A Programing Paradigm, revolves around objects which are real world instances of entities like Class, which can be defined as a template for Characterstics and Behaviours.

**Need**

1. Easy to understand
2. High Readability and Mantainability
3. Brings program closer to real world

Languages Like Java, C++, JS, Python support OOPs.

**Other Paradigms**

1. Imperitive
    1. Procedural
    2. Declarative

2. Declarative
    1. Logical
    2. Database Processing

Structured Programming : Structuted Control Flow, use of if/else, while and other loops, block structures.

**Features of OOPs**

1. Polymorphism
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritence
4. Data Abstraction

**Advantages**

1. Helpful in solving Complex Problems.
2. Promotes Code reusability and Reduces Code Redundancy.
3. Data Abstraction
4. High Mantainability
5. Easy to Understand

**Object** An instance of a class, contains entities like Members and Behaviours. Represents an actual entity in Real World while a Class is simply a Blue-Print.

**Encapsulation** The act of placing all the similar Functionality and Data under a Single Unit or Capsule.

1. Hides Data
2. Binds Data

**Polymorphism** The act of Same code behaving differently with Different input or conditions. 

1. Runtime  : Function Overriding   : Binding done at Run Time.
2. Compile  : Function Overloading  : Binding done at Compile Time.

**Inheritence** Child inheriting properties, entities and behaviour from Parents. Use definition of functions from Parent class. Keeps code simple, readable and reusable.

**Abstraction** Hding unneccessary details from the user and showing only relevant details.

**Q1. How much memory does Class Occupy?**

The consume no memory, they are simple blueprints and don't exist in real world.

Structure vs Class in C++

|Structure|Class|
|:---|:---|
|Bydefault Public|By Default Private|
|No Polymorphism and Inheritence|Polymorphism and Inheritence|
|Memory allocated in Stack|In Heap|

**Short Comings Of Inheritence**

1. Takes longer time to process.
2. Tight Coupling between Child and Parent.
3. Might be complex for implementation by New Users.
y 
**Types of Inheritence**

1. Single
2. Multiple
3. Multilevel
4. Heirarchial

SubClass = Child Class
Super Class = Parent Class

**Interface**

A special feature available in Java, where the functions are declared without their Definition. One cannot create objects out of Interfaces. Allows Multiple Inheritence.

**How is Abstraction Accomplished?**

Abstract Classes and Abstract Functions

**Abstract Class** A special class with only Abstract function ie only Declaratio and No Definition. The main difference between Interface and Abstract class is that when an Interface is Implemented all of it's Function must be Implemented.

**Exception** A special event raised during the Runtime, incase an unforseen circumstance occurs to make sure that the Program does not crash and keeps running while taking neccessary steps.

**Garbage Collection** OOPs revolves around objects each of which requires memory and other resources, thus their Deallocation after their use is extremely important.

Garbage Collection is basically is basically the mechanism for handling memory that has been used and de-allocated.
