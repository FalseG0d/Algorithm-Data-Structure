# Greedy Apporach

An algorithmic approcah the follows the problem solving approach of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a globally optimum solution.

Pros: Simple, Easy to Implement, Runs Fast.
Cons: Very few cases where we get globally optimum solution.

**When to Use**

Problems based on Greedy Approach has 2 Properties:

1. Greedy-Choice Property:  A global optimum can be arrived at by selecting a local optimum.
2. Optimal Substructure:    An optimal solution to the problem contains an optimal solution to subproblem.

**Applications**

1. Activity Selection Problem
2. Huffman Coding
3. Job Sequencing Problem
4. Fractional Knapsack Problem
5. Prim's Min Spanning Tree

**Problems**

2. [Prims-Algorithm](./PrimsAlgorithm.md)
